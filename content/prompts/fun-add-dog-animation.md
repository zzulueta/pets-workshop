# Puppy Cursor Follower

Add an adorable cartoon dog to the bottom-right corner of the website that follows the user's cursor with its eyes, similar to the classic XEyes program from X11.

## Requirements:
- The dog should be cute and cartoony with expressive eyes
- Eyes should smoothly track the cursor position across the entire screen
- Position the dog in the bottom-right corner as a fixed element (sticky positioning)
- Dog should remain visible even when the page is scrolled
- Add a slight head tilt or ear wiggle on mouse clicks for extra charm
- Optional: Make the dog occasionally blink or perform a random animation
