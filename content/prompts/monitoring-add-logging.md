Add logging commands to server application which is written in python

The Python Flask is stored in #folder:server 

Create a standardized logging system for the Python Flask with the following requirements:

1. LOGGING LEVELS: Implement five distinct logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) with clear usage guidelines for each.

2. FORMAT CONSISTENCY: Define a consistent log entry format including:
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm)
   - Log level
   - Module/component name
   - Thread ID (where applicable)
   - Message content

3. CONFIGURATION: Provide a configuration system that allows:
   - Setting global minimum log level
   - Per-module logging levels
   - Multiple output destinations (console, file, external service)
   - Log rotation settings for file outputs

4. CODE EXAMPLES: Include example implementations showing:
   - Proper logger initialization
   - Correct usage of each log level
   - Error/exception logging with stack traces
   - Context-enriched logging

5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: Address how to optimize logging for production environments.

The solution should be maintainable, follow industry best practices, and minimize performance impact.
