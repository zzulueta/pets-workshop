# Pets Workshop Prompts

This directory contains various prompts designed for different aspects of development and enhancement of the Pets Workshop project. These prompts are meant for illustration purposes only.

## Prompt Overview

### Interface and User Experience

- **[fun-add-themes](./fun-add-themes.md)**: Adds a theme selector dropdown that allows users to switch between multiple visual themes including 80s Retro, Terminal Classic, Hand-Sketched, Steampunk, and Fantasy Realm. Enhances user customization and visual appeal.

- **[fun-add-dog-animation](./fun-add-dog-animation.md)**: Implements an interactive cartoon dog animation in the bottom-right corner of the website that follows the user's cursor with its eyes. The dog remains visible while scrolling and has extra animations on mouse clicks, adding a playful element to the user experience.

### Backend Development

- **[conversion-convert-flask-to-golang](./conversion-convert-flask-to-golang.md)**: Provides instructions for migrating the existing Python Flask server to a Go-based implementation while maintaining identical functionality, API endpoints, and response formats. The goal is to create a functionally equivalent server using Go's standard library.

- **[monitoring-add-logging](./monitoring-add-logging.md)**: Details requirements for implementing a comprehensive logging system in the Python Flask server with multiple logging levels, consistent formatting, configuration options, and performance considerations. This improves monitoring, debugging, and operational visibility.
